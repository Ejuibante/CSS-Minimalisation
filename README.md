<h1>CSS-Minimalisation</h1>

<h4>A place where you can get css files that run alongside Stylus (A broswer extension), to minimalise certain areas of the web, making web browsing and using way more enjoyable without just entering a doom-like scroll state. Actually enjoying the web. This is a pledge for an old internet, where we are the masters of our web usage.</h4>

<p> As of now there are two files namley teh two soundcloud CSS files, that work alongside the browser extesnsion stylus, you can download the files itself and paste it into stylus, or simply go to the raw file link which should be automatically detected by stylus and you can install it that way. But for the simplest install, I'll provide links for both:</p>
