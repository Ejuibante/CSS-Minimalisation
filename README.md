A place where you can get css files that run alongside Stylus (A broswer extension), to minimalise certain areas of the web, making web browsing and using way more enjoyable without just entering a doom-like scroll state. Actually enjoying the web. This is a pledge for an old internet, where we are the masters of our web usage.
