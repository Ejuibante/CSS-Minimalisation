<h1>CSS-Minimalisation</h1>

<h4>A place where you can get css files that run alongside Stylus (A broswer extension), to minimalise certain areas of the web, making web browsing and using way more enjoyable without just entering a doom-like scroll state. Actually enjoying the web. This is a pledge for an old internet, where we are the masters of our web usage.</h4>

<p> As of now there are two files namley the two soundcloud CSS files, that work alongside the browser extesnsion stylus, you can download the files itself and paste it into stylus, or simply go to the raw file link which should be automatically detected by stylus and you can install it that way. But for the simplest install, I'll provide links for both:</p>

<p>CSS Soundcloud Part 1 (Minimal):<a href="https://github.com/Ejuibante/CSS-Minimalisation/raw/refs/heads/main/SoundCloud_CSS_Part_1.user.css"> Install Here</a>!</p>
<p>CSS Soundcloud Part 2 (Minimal):<a href="https://github.com/Ejuibante/CSS-Minimalisation/raw/refs/heads/main/SoundCloud_CSS_Part_2.user.css"> Install Here</a>!</p>

<p>(Btw it might be useful to learn the keyboard shortcuts for soundcloud like: Shift + L = Loop  These shortcuts still work with the CSS enabled, and it removes functions like the loop button, for a cleaner look, thats why i insist on using the shortcuts if those extra functions are important to you, especially because they still work in the CSS so go ahead and use them! If you want)</p>
<p> Okay, now looking back on this, this is a huge disclaimer, there is also no search bar, so if you want to search you will need to use the adress bar and type https://soundcloud.com/search/sounds?q=(here you write your request), personally i reccomend formatting it within your browser so when you type sc it auto chnages into that url, and you can just type your request, this is really helpful for a minimal feel; settings > privacy, search and services > search and connected experiences > adress bar and search > search engines > add search engine > set search engine as soundcloud, shortcut as sc, and url as https://soundcloud.com/search/sounds?q=%s Done thats it, now you can just search sc with the name of the subject your searching afterwards and itll work perfectly.            </p>
